This  transition  can  lead  to  the  imposition  of  \nrules  and  expectations,  fostering  possessiveness.  Without  self-\nreflection, we may feel entitled to hold specific expectations over \nsomeone  who  has  become  our  ‘special’  one.

This attempt to \nfind reassurance stems from our anxiety and insecurity, which can \nnever truly be satisfied.\nThe  term  “cathexis,”  derived  from  the  Greek  word  meaning  ‘I  \noccupy,’  refers  to  the  emotional  investment  we  make  in  others  \nand things, treating them as integral parts of ourselves.
